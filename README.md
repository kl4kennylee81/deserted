**We are building a turn based action game for CS 3152 at Cornell University**

In a deep desert land where humans and spirits coexist, society is rigidly divided. For eons arrogant noblemen have used their knowledge of spirits to suppress the masses. Hunger and squalor is all the masses know. For them, the only chance of liberation is the Tournament. Since Ancient Times, every 100 years, there is an open tournament where anyone can challenge the spiritual might of the noblemen. But victory has always seemed impossible--until now. A young orphan from the furthest, most barren corner of the land hears murmurings of a spiritual call. Guide MC to the capital, to enter the tournament, and bring liberation to his people.
