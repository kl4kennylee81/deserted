/* 
 * SoundController.java
 *
 * Sound is one of the trickiest things to manage in a game. While playing
 * sounds is easy, it is always difficult to figure out what classes the
 * the sounds should go into.  This is compounded by the fact that sounds
 * DO NOT align with frame boundaries and run across multiple frames.
 *
 * For this application, we have solved this problem by using a static 
 * class for the sound controller.  Static classes benefit from the fact
 * that they can be used anywhere and we never need to worry about storing
 * a reference to them.  Just use the classname and you are done.
 *
 * To be a candidate for a static class, the class should never need to
 * change state (after initialization) and should never need to reference
 * any other class in the application.  Both of these are true here.
